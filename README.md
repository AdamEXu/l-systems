# L-system

**L-system** is a Lindenmayer system simulator built using the Corona SDK. It visualizes complex fractal patterns and shapes generated by recursive rewriting rules. This project allows users to explore various predefined L-system shapes, adjust their parameters like generations, and interact with their visualizations in a dynamic way.

## Features

- **Predefined Shapes**: Visualize popular L-system patterns like the Koch Curve, Sierpinski Triangle, Dragon Curve, and more.
- **Dynamic Generations**: Increase or decrease the number of recursive generations to observe how the patterns evolve.
- **Interactive Controls**: Simple stepper controls for switching between shapes and modifying generations.
- **Color Cycling**: Patterns cycle through a predefined palette of colors for an engaging visual experience.
- **Customizable Rules**: The code supports adding or modifying L-system rules for experimentation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **[Corona SDK](https://coronalabs.com/)**: Ensure you have Corona SDK installed, as the project is developed specifically for this platform.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdamEXu/l-systems.git
   cd l-system
   ```

2. **Open the project**: Open the folder in the Corona Simulator.

3. **Run the application**: In the simulator, run the `main.lua` file to visualize the L-system patterns.

4. **Interact and Explore**:
   - Use the generation stepper to modify recursion depth.
   - Use the shape stepper to explore different predefined patterns.
   - Reload colors using the "Reload Colors" button.
